# Purpose of Time Series Forecasting Project
The goal of the Time Series Forecasting project was to familiarise myself with the different methods that are used for this. 
For this purpose, I started with the ARIMA models, which strictly speaking do not belong to the neural networks, 
but are often used in machine learning. Since ARIMA models deliver good results for simple time series data, 
but reach their limits with complex time series data, I next examined pure feed-forward neural networks. These gave acceptable results. 
Finally, I investigated LSTM neural networks, which gave the best results, especially for complex time series data. 
Since I majored in finance during my studies, I used this project to predict stock prices, because it is in my interest.
